Enhanced er model - generalization specialization and aggregation

As the complexity increased, it became difficult to use traditional er models. Hence improvements were made to these three things.

Generalization:
    Bottom-up approach
    in which two lower levels of entities combine to form a higher-level entity. In this, the higher level entity can also combine with other lower level.
    super calls and sub-class system. 

Specialization:
    Top-down approach
    in which a higher-level entity is divided into two or more lower-level entities. In this, lower-level entities can also combine with other higher-level entities.
    opposite to generalization a higher entity may not have any lower-level entity sets.

Aggregation:
    where the relationship between two entities is treated as a single entity.
    it is commonly used to connect different entity types based on a common relationship.
    used to depict the operational line execution elements or functional behaviors of a similar type of common attributes.
    "has-a" "is-part-of" relationship

BCNF
    boyle's code normal form
    a normal form that is used to normalize a relation in a database.
    it is a 3rd normal form
   
    1. every determinant must be a candidate key.
    2. every non-prime attribute must be fully functionally dependent on the candidate key.
