Regular Expressions:

    A regular expression in javascript is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.

    The search pattern can be used for text search and text replace operations

    When you search for data in a text you can use this search pattern to describe what you are searching for.

    A regular expression can be a single character or a more complicated pattern.

        i - perform case sensitive matching
        g - perform a global match (find all matches rather than stopping after the first match)
        m - perform multiline matching
