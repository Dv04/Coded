Quite a handful of these have compared one to the other but few have gathered all 3 in one go. Therefore this notebook will aim to provide an introductory exposition on these 3 methods as well as to portray their visualisations interactively and hopefully more intuitively via the Plotly visualisation library.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n","\n","In a nutshell, PCA is a linear transformation algorithm that seeks to project the original features of our data onto a smaller set of features ( or subspace ) while still retaining most of the information. To do this the algorithm tries to find the most appropriate directions/angles ( which are the principal components ) that maximise the variance in the new subspace. Why maximise the variance though? \n","\n","To answer the question, more context has to be given about the PCA method. One has to understand that the principal components are orthogonal to each other ( think right angle ). As such when generating the covariance matrix ( measure of how related 2 variables are to each other ) in our new subspace, the off-diagonal values of the covariance matrix will be zero and only the diagonals ( or eigenvalues) will be non-zero. It is these diagonal values that represent the *variances* of the principal components that we are talking about or information about the variability of our features. \n","\n","Therefore when PCA seeks to maximise this variance, the method is trying to find directions ( principal components ) that contain the largest spread/subset of data points or information ( variance ) relative to all the data points present.

We touched on the concepts of finding principal components and linear discriminants as well as the topology preserving capabilities of t-SNE. We've also discussed the relative merits of using supervised and unsupervised methods as well as the KMeans clustering technique when it comes to an unsupervised scenario.  \n","\n","Apart from these three common reduction methods, there exists a whole host of other dimensionality reduction methods not discussed in this notebook. Just to name a few, they include methods like Sammon's Mapping, Multi-dimensional Scaling or even some graph based visualisation methods.  \n","\n","I hope this notebook has been useful especially with regards to introducing the concepts of dimensionality reduction if it is new to you. And the key takeaway would be that each method has its own pros and cons and are not to be used as a one-size-fits-all/I-will-only-use-my-favourite method but rather to be implemented as the situation calls for it. \n","\n","Peace out "]}],"metadata":{"_change_revision":0,"_is_fork":false,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.5"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
