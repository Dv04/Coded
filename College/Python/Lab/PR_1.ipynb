    "# Charateristics of python and explain type, input and print. \n",
    "### Characteristics of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python, a versatile and dynamic programming language, boasts an array of distinctive characteristics that contribute to its popularity and applicability across various domains:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Readability and Simplicity\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's syntax emphasizes readability and simplicity, making it easy for developers to express concepts concisely and clearly. The reduced use of punctuation and verbose keywords simplifies code comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Versatility and Portability\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's versatility shines through its compatibility across diverse platforms and operating systems. A single codebase can often run seamlessly on various environments without modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extensive Standard Library\n",
    "\n",
    "Python offers an extensive standard library, equipping developers with a myriad of built-in modules and functions that streamline development tasks. This library covers areas from file handling to web services.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dynamic Typing and Memory Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's dynamic typing enables flexible variable assignments without explicit type declarations. Additionally, its automatic memory management alleviates the need for manual memory allocation and deallocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpreted Nature\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's interpreted nature promotes an iterative and rapid development cycle. Developers can quickly test and execute code snippets, facilitating efficient debugging and troubleshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Type, Input, and Print Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "To delve into Python's core functionalities, let's explore three essential functions: `type`, `input`, and `print`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The `type()` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `type` function in Python allows you to determine the data type of a given object. It aids in introspection and understanding the nature of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "num = 42\n",
    "name = \"John\"\n",
    "is_valid = True\n",
    "\n",
    "print(type(num))      # Output: <class 'int'>\n",
    "print(type(name))     # Output: <class 'str'>\n",
    "print(type(is_valid)) # Output: <class 'bool'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The `input()` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `input()` function serves as a bridge between your Python program and the user. It enables you to prompt users for input and receive text-based responses. The syntax for the `input()` function is simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "user_input = input(\"Please enter your name: \")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The `print()` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of Python programming, the `print` function stands as a fundamental tool for displaying information to the console. This function enables you to convey messages, values, and results, making it an essential component of your coding journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(object(s), sep=separator, end=end, file=file, flush=flush)\n",
    "```"
