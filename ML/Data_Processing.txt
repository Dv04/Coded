    Preparing To Model:

        Understand the type of data in the given input dataset
        Explore the data to understand the data quality
        Explore the relationship among data elements
        Find Potential issues in the data
        Remediate data if needed
        Data Preprocessing (if needed):
            - Dimensionality reduction
                E.g. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
            - Feature subset selection

    Learning:

        Data Partitioning
        Model Selection
        Cross-validation

    Performance Evaluation:

        Examine the model performance
        Visualize performance trade-offs using ROC curves

        Note: ROC is the Reciever Operating Characteristics curve. It allows a graphical representation of test data accuracy and allows the comparison of such tests.

    Performance Improvement:

        Tuning the model
        Ensembling
        Bagging
        Boosting

        Note: Bagging is a way of combining prediction that belongs to the same types.
              Boosting is a way of combining predictions that belongs to the different types

    Types of Data:
    |
    |--- Qualitative Data:
    |    |
    |    |--- Nominal Data
    |    |--- Ordinal Data
    |   
    |--- Quantitative Data:
    |    |
    |    |--- Interval Data
    |    |--- Ratio Data

Qualitative Data:

    It provides information about the quality of an object or information which can not be measured

    E.g. Quality of students (Good or Bad)
         Name and roll number of students. (211310142006, Dev Sanghvi)

    Can be subdivided as:

        - Nominal Data
        - Ordinal Data
    
    Nominal Data: 
        One which has no numeric value but has a named value.
        E.g. Blood Groups(A-, B+)
            Nationalities (Indian, British, Australian, Americal, etc...)
            Gender (Male or Female)

        Can not perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication. That's why also can not perform statistical operations.
        The basic count is possible so mode, i.e. Most frequently occurring value can be identified for nominal data.

    Ordinal Data: 
        In addition to possessing the properties of nominal data, can also be arranged naturally
        E.g. Customer Satisfaction (Happy, Normal, Bad)
             Hardness of metal (Hard, Normal, Soft)

        Basic counting is possible. So mode can be identified.
        Ordering is possible so Median and quartiles are possible.

Quantitative Data:

    Relates to the information about the quantity of data.
    E.g. Consider the attribute `marks`. It can be measured on a numeric scale.

    Can be subdivided in:

        - Interval Data
        - Ratio Data

    Interval Data: 
        Not only value is known but also the exact difference b/w value is also known.
        E.g. Temperature (Celsius, Fahrenheit)
             Time (24-hour clock)

        Mathematical operations are possible.
        Mean, Median, Mode, and Standard Deviation are possible. 

    Ratio Data:

        Having the same properties as interval data, with an equal and definitive ratio between data.
        E.g. Height, Weight, Distance, etc...
