Cost function:
    Helps to measure the extent to which the model is going wrong in estimating the relationship between X and Y

Loss function:
    same as the cost function only difference is that it is usually a function defined on a data point while the cost function is for the entire training data set.

Types of ml for resolving different types of problems

Supervised learning:
    Regression
    Classification

Unsupervised learning:
    Clustering
    Dimensionality reduction

Selection:

    ML is of 2 types Supervised (focused on solving predictive problems) and unsupervised ()

    Supervised:

        Attempts to establish a relation between the target feature i.e. the feature being predicted and the predictor features.

        The models that are used for the prediction of target features of categorical value are known as Classification models.
        E.g. KNN, Na√Øve Bayes, Decision tree

        Predictive models may also be used to predict numerical values of target features based on the predictive features. These are known as Regression models.
        E.g. Linear regression, Logistic regression

        SVM and Neural Networks are used for both.

    Unsupervised:

        Used to describe a data set or gain insight from a data set.
        No target feature or single feature in this case.
        Interesting patterns or insights are derived from the data set.
        
        Descriptive models which group similar data instances are known as clustering models.
        E.g. K-means
