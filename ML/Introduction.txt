Overview:

    Learning: Process of gaining information through Observations.
    Types:

        Learning directly under expert guidance:
            - Parents teach infants
            - Professional mentors
        
            Learning guided by knowledge gained from experts:
            - Learning happens with the knowledge which has been imparted by a teacher or mentor at some point in time in some other form or context

        Self-Learning:
            - Learning when we are left to learn on our own

Preface:

    Machine Learning: Teaching the Machine to think like a human from Past data to predict the future.
    
    or
    
    A computer program is said to learn from experience E concerning some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

Note:

- A machine can be considered to learn if it is able to gather experiences by doing a certain task and improve its performance in doing similar tasks in the future.

- Here, The past experience is past data which is input to the machine learning program or machine from other sources.

How?

    Data -> Abstraction -> Generalization

    Data: Past data or information is utilized as a basis for future decision-making.

    Abstraction: the input data is represented in a broader way through the underlying algorithm.

    Generalization: The abstracted representation is generalized to form a framework for making decisions.
