Exploring Categorical Data:

    Scatter Plot:

        Helps in visualizing bivariate relationship. i.e. the relationship between two variables.
        It is a two-dimensional plot in which points or dots are drawn on coordinates.
        The first variable is plotted on the x-axis and the second variable is plotted on the y-axis.

    Two-way Cross-tabulations:

        Gives the relationship of two categorical attributes concisely.
        Matrix format that presents a summarized view of the relationship

Pre-processing:

    Dimensionality reduction:

        High-dimensional data sets need a high amount of computational space and time features are not useful and may degrade the performance of machine learning algorithms.
        Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables.

Feature Subset Selection:

    Try to find out the optimal subset of the entire feature set which significantly reduces computational cost without major impact on learning accuracy
    A feature is considered irrelevant if,
        It plays an insignificant role in classifying or grouping...
