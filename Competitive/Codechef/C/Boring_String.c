/**
A string is called boring if all the characters of the string are same.

You are given a string S of length N, consisting of lowercase english alphabets. Find the length of the longest boring substring of S which occurs more than once.

Note that if there is no boring substring which occurs more than once in S, the answer will be 0.

A substring is obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) elements from the beginning of the string and some (possibly zero) elements from the end of the string.
