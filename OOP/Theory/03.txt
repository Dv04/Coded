Exception handling:

    An exception is an abnormal condition that arises in a code sequence at run time. it is a runtime error.
    Java exception is an object that describes an exceptional condition in the code
    
    Process:
        
        problem occurs -> create exception -> throw exception -> handle exception

    When an exceptional condition arises, an object representing that exception is created and thrown in the method that caused the error. A method may choose to handle the exception itself or pass it on. The exception is said to be caught and processed.

    The exception can be handled by the Java run-time system. They are fundamental errors that violate the rules of the Java language or the constraints of the Java execution environment.
    Manually generated exceptions are typically used to report some error condition to the caller of a method.

    Throwable Types:
    
        Errors:

            StackOverflow error
            Virtual Machine error
            Out-of-memory error

        Exception:

            IOException
            SQL exception
            ClassNotFoundException
            Runtime exception:

                ArithmeticException
                NullPointerException
                NumberFormatException
                IndexOutOfBoundsException:

                    Array IndexOutOfBoundsException
                    String IndexOutOfBoundsException

Checked exception vs Unchecked exception:

    RuntimeException, error and their subclasses are known as unchecked exceptions.
    All other exceptions are known as checked exceptions meaning that the compiler forces the programmer to check this.

    Checked:

        ClassNotFoundException
        InterruptedException
        IOException
        InstantiationException
        SQLException
        FileNotFoundException

    Unchecked:

        ArithmeticException
        ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
        ClassCastException
        NullPointerException
        NumberFormatException
        IllegalArgumentException
        IllegalStateException
