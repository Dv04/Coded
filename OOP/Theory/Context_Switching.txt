Synchronization:

    The thread may share data structure and need to communicate too
        
        - For example, prevent one thread from writing data while another thread is in the middle of reading it.

    A control mechanism in JAVA is used to protect a shared asset from being manipulated by more than one thread at a time.

JAVA Monitors:

    Each object has its implicit Monitors that are automatically entered when one of the synchronized methods is called.

    Once a thread is inside a synchronized method, no other thread can call any other synchronized method on the same spot

Thread and runnable
    JAVA multithreading system is built on the thread class and its methods.
